This is a guide and note for the creation of my final project with the working name "Finance Clone" and tag line "Facebook meets google finance".


//// Topic: Initial Rails Installation ////

$ rails _4.0.2_ new finance_clone --database postgresql


config/database.yml by adding username: maxplomer and host: localhost

When using postgresql, you should also run the command

$ rake db:create:all

add .DS_Store and .localized to .gitignore

in the terminal before trying to run migrations

# Add to Gemfile
group :development do
  gem 'better_errors'
  gem 'binding_of_caller'
  gem 'pry-rails'
  gem 'quiet_assets'
end






//// Topic: stock_quote ruby gem ////

https://github.com/tyrauber/stock_quote


Include the gem in your Gemfile:

gem "stock_quote"


sample usage:


$ gem install stock_quote
$ irb
> require 'stock_quote'
> stock = StockQuote::Stock.quote("tsla")
> stock.ask_realtime
 => 222.65 



//// Topic: need to have a script that runs every minute in background ////

    end
  end
end
