This is a guide and note for the creation of my final project with the working name "Finance Clone" and tag line "Facebook meets google finance".


//// Topic: Initial Rails Installation ////

$ rails _4.0.2_ new finance_clone --database postgresql


config/database.yml by adding username: maxplomer and host: localhost

When using postgresql, you should also run the command

$ rake db:create:all

add .DS_Store and .localized to .gitignore

in the terminal before trying to run migrations

# Add to Gemfile
group :development do
  gem 'better_errors'
  gem 'binding_of_caller'
  gem 'pry-rails'
  gem 'quiet_assets'
end






//// Topic: stock_quote ruby gem ////

https://github.com/tyrauber/stock_quote


Include the gem in your Gemfile:

gem "stock_quote"


sample usage:


$ gem install stock_quote
$ irb
> require 'stock_quote'
> stock = StockQuote::Stock.quote("tsla")
> stock.ask_realtime
 => 222.65 







//// price model ////


$ rails generate model Quote

attributes: price and company_id

migration file:

class CreateQuotes < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :quotes do |t|
      t.integer :company_id, :null => false
      t.float :price, :null => false 

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end


//// company model ////

$ rails generate model Company

attributes: name and symbol

migration file:

class CreateCompanies < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :companies do |t|
      t.string :name, :null => false
      t.string :symbol, :null => false
      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end







//// seeds.rb ////

added

Company.create(name: "Apple Inc.", symbol: "AAPL")
Quote.create(company_id: 1, price: 105.23)




//// run migrate and seed /////

$ rake db:migrate db:seed

go into console and make sure company and price is there


$ commit -m "initial rails setup"



//// Topic: need to have a script that runs every minute in background ////

store stock quote price monday-friday 9:30am to 4pm

i tried google search for: script that runs every minute rails

intermediate step will be calling stock_quote in seeds.rb file to set price



From:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/285717/a-cron-job-for-rails-best-practices

I found:

https://github.com/javan/whenever

which is a ruby gem for writing and deploying cron jobs

cron is a time-based job scheduler







it seems like what i need to do is run this scheduler at system startup

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3790867/ruby-on-rails-run-a-method-on-server-start-2-3

can put method call at bottom of boot.rb? NO



$ cd /desktop/finance_clone
$ wheneverize .


add to config/schedule.rb

every 1.second do
  symbol = "FSLR"

  company = Company.find_by_symbol(symbol)
  company_id = company.id

  stock = StockQuote::Stock.quote("tsla")
  price = stock.ask_realtime
   
  Quote.create(company_id: company_id, price: price)
end



Or with Bundler in your Gemfile.

gem 'whenever', :require => false

note: i did not include     :require => false    because I want to just include it everywhere



In your "config/boot.rb" file:

require "whenever/capistrano"  NO triggers error



maybe i need to write require 'whenever'  first?





//////////////////////////////////////////////


created:   Quote.update_quotes method



class Quote < ActiveRecord::Base

  def self.update_quotes
    companies = Company.all;

    companies.each do |company|
      company_id = company.id
      stock = StockQuote::Stock.quote(symbol)
      price = stock.ask_realtime
      Quote.create(company_id: company_id, price: price)
    end
  end

end



to copy the schedule file to crontab

$ whenever --update-crontab


want to run in development environment

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1070231/rails-cron-with-whenever-setting-the-environment

my schedule.rb file:

every 1.minute do
  runner "Quote.update_quotes", :environment => 'development'
end



to remove task

$ crontab -e

opens in vim

shift s to delete line

esc to escape view

shift ; w q   to save and exit





git commit -m "update quotes and whenever gem working"



/////////////////////////////////////

now need auth/ user model, routes and controllers to create portfolio page



$ rails generate model User
$ rails generate controller users
$ rails generate controller sessions


migration file for User model:

class CreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :users do |t|
      t.string :name, :null => false
      t.string :email, :null => false
      t.string :password_digest, :null => false
      t.string :session_token, :null => false

      t.timestamps
    end
    
    add_index :users, :email, :unique => true
    add_index :users, :session_token, :unique => true

  end
end





filling out users_controller, sessions_controller, routes.rb, user.rb model file, application_controller, associated views

add to gemfile 
gem 'bcrypt', '~> 3.1.7'


make sure to do bundle install and run db migrations


git commit -m "add user authentication"


//////////////////////////////////

need edit user page, in value="" in my input elements?

want to make sure you can see other user's show page


add edit method in users controller

and edit view erb file


/////////////////////////////////

remove require sign_in for users#show

change root to new user


$ rails generate controller companies


how to have page auto refresh for quote? easy in backbone
   -just have user press refresh for rails version or all versions

how to calculate the percent up? for alerts, and also company show




could grab all quotes in an array!!!!
stocks = StockQuote::Stock.quote(["aapl", "tsla"])
much better, do this before portfolio page?


/////////////////////////////////



deploy to heroku

$ heroku git:remote -a finance-clone
$ git push heroku master
$ heroku run bundle exec rake db:migrate db:seed


need to run cron job thing


upload to github
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/maxplomer/finance-clone.git
$ git push -u origin master





/////////////////////////////////


if place trade and ask if nil, want to put in errors that market is closed, and redirect back to user's page


later might have scheduled trade feature


user has many trades association, display trades on users show page

wanna make sure if is our list of companies

/////////////////////////////////

note: don't want people to place trades with 0 shares, put validation in trade file?




don't create recent quotes if we don't have that stock ticker, redirect to root


put plug sign in front of percent gain on user show page, also do that on change and percent change on company show page

would prefer when error "we dont trade that ticker" is given, should render page already on! (last recent quote if signed in, otherwise root?, or have recent quotes for users not signed in)

even when click follow only, still show yourself
